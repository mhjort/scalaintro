Exercise 1
----------
Implement a simple calculator in Scala, using basic language constructs such as variables (var, val), functions (def),
and classes. Required operations for the calculator are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square (x^2).
Implement a console app (object with main method) that uses the calculator to perform the following
calculations and output the result on the console:

square(((2 + 3) * 4) / 5)
sum(square( i )) where i = 1 .. 100

Exercise 2
----------

Implement a simple calculator in Scala (with the same operations as in Exercise 1),
applying fp-style concepts such as pattern matching, recursion, higher-order functions and case classes.

Once again, perform these calculations and output the results on the console

square(((2 + 3) * 4) / 5)
sum(square( i )) where i = 1 .. 100
